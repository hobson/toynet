Toy problems to identify the right Neural Net structure for various problem types, starting with topic vector cosine-distance-type unsupervised learning problems typical of NLP semantic indexing and search.


# Description

No idea where this is headed, but basically just a way for me to deploy some NN experiments on my "supercomputer."

## Note

Thank you PyScaffold, for making best-practice project setup automatic.
